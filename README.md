Clustering and classification for structural damage portfolio after 2015 earthquake in Nepal

Following the 7.8 magnitude Gorkha earthquake on April 25, 2015, Nepal conducted a massive household survey using mobile technology to assess building damage in earthquake-affected districts. The data was collected between January 2016 and May 2016. 

This is a clusterring and classification data analysis project in R Markdown. I have used the Structural dataset, which includes floor type, roof type, foundation type, and other structural-related information for each building along with damage level. Data cleaning was done separately, and the dataset to be processed was stored in an RData file. It should be noted that this file is an extract of the original dataset, which contains over 750â€™000 observations.
